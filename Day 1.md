## SGCS DAY 1 – BASICS

**3-day training agenda:**

* Basics
* Roadmap
* Certification
* Realtime Event Analysis
* QnA
* Expert Advice

**Today’s Work:**

* Basics
* Roadmap

---

## 🛡️ BASICS OF CYBER SECURITY

* Network Basic and OS
* Incident Handling
* Problem-solving and Analytical Skills
* Common Security Tools

---

## 🎯 Interview Pattern and Questions

Topics:

* OSI Layer
* Common Network Ports
* How the Network Works
* How the Firewall Will Work
* Cyber Kill Chain
* OWASP TOP 10 (recently changed)
* Common Attacks
* Learn Easy Attack Patterns

> Questions are mainly focused on Network Layer, Transport Layer, and Application Layer.

**At interview for OSI layer:**

* Layers 1–3 → Physical Layer
* Layer 4 → Heart
* Layers 5–7 → Software Layer

✅ Know the number of the layers.

---

### 💡 Use Case:

Assume if a person is trying to crash two servers – the first server is crashed by flooding requests or DoS.

> Focus on **Network Layer** and **Application Layer** – this is due to the nature of cloud environments where you never access the Physical Layer.

---

## 🔌 Common Network Ports

📌 Remember at least **10 ports** and their purpose.

---

## 🔍 SIM Tools:

When you get hacked, the tech guy gets your source of the attack and they will use this to find how to mitigate it to not happen again by using a **jump system** to test it and analyze it.

---

## 🧰 OSec Tool:

* Captures logs from the domains

---

## 🧪 SNOT:

* Captures firewalls in the network
* Categorizes it (e.g., Apache, etc.)
* Detects DoS, Bruteforce, and IAM attacks
* Provides well-written statistics: categories, sources, ports, number of occurrences, etc.

---

## 🔥 Firewall Log Behavior:

* When something malicious is identified, the firewall drops the packet.
* Happens at **Layer 1 (L1)** and a **ticket is punched** to inform the senior.

---

## 🔐 How Firewall Works:

* Works based on **rules**
* Example: For inter-domain traffic, rules are written for **one-way** (source → destination)
* Specific ports are set for particular applications (e.g., browsers: `8080`, `443`, `TCP`, `HTTPS`)
* Policies are written in **inspection mode**, not access mode

---

## 🗺️ ROADMAP OF CS

**Blue Team:**

* Security Analyst
* Security Engineer
* Incident Responder
* Application Security
* Endpoint Security
* Cloud Security
* Data Engineer
* ...etc

**Red Team:**

* Penetration Tester
* Vulnerability Analyst

**GRC:**

* Compliance Analyst
* Security Auditor

📌 **NOTE:** Certifications for these roles will be discussed tomorrow.

🧠 Easier to configure **server, database, and network** in cloud than on a system.

---

## 🛠️ TOOLS

* Qualys
* NessusPro
* Proofpoint
* FortiSIM
* ISO27001 (GRC)

**SIEM** – Security, Analysis, Cloud
**IAM** – Support tools for GRC

**Safeguard Security Firewall Tool:** Checkpoint

---

## ⚙️ Firewall Configuration

1. Add the rule and name it
2. Select Source, Destination
3. Choose the Ports and Time
4. Choose the Action: **Inspect / Bypass**

   * Bypass is usually chosen
5. Install it and choose the gateways
6. Raise the request
